# This is a very brief template repo designed to showcase the [`Vitae`](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/) R Package. 

The vitae package makes creating and maintaining a Résumé or CV with R Markdown simple. It provides a collection of LaTeX and HTML templates, with helpful functions to add content to the documents.

Spreadsheets are designed to be updated *as and when* new acheivements/milestones are made, rendering the Rmarkdown document through the vitae template will generate an autoformatted CV that looks great!
